# Detecting_subtle_behavioural_changes

Software used in publication : [link](link)

This repo contains three independent projects :
- maggotuba, a nonlinear dimensionnality reduction tool for larva tracking trajectories and tools to quantify deviations between an experiment and its control
- Physics_informed_regularization_codes, a tool to regularize larval outlines obtained from the MWT/Choreography pipeline, using bayesian inference with a physical prior
- Suffix, a notebook to perform sequence analyses using a suffix tree. The suffix tree data structure originates from computational genetics where it is used to analyze sequences of nucleotides. Here, it is used to analyze sequences of discrete behaviors, as obtained by a separate classification pipeline.
